Okay, I'm ready to dive into this Deep Research tool project! Let's analyze the provided code, brainstorm improvements, and then I'll present a revamped version.

*First, let's understand the existing code's purpose and functionality.* I'll assume the `deep_research.py` script at the provided GitHub link aims to perform in-depth research on a given topic by:

1.  Taking a user's research query.
2.  Generating related sub-questions or aspects of the main query.
3.  Searching the web for information on each sub-question.
4.  Summarizing the findings from multiple sources.
5.  Presenting a comprehensive report or answer to the user.

This is conceptually similar to how large language models (LLMs) like those from OpenAI can perform "deep dives" into a topic.

*Now, let's do some "deep dive research" ourselves on how to enhance such a tool.* I will use Google Search to explore best practices, potential libraries, and improvement strategies.

Based on my research and understanding, here's a breakdown of the key improvements and the reasoning behind them, followed by the updated code:

**Key Improvements and Rationale:**

1.  **Robust Web Scraping:**
    *   **Problem with original (assumed):**  The original code likely used a basic method for fetching web pages (e.g., the `requests` library alone).  This is easily blocked by websites employing anti-bot measures.  It also wouldn't handle dynamically loaded content (JavaScript-heavy sites).
    *   **Solution:** Integrate `ZenRows` (or a similar service like `Scrapfly`). ZenRows (and Scrapfly) handles rotating proxies, browser fingerprinting, CAPTCHA solving, and JavaScript rendering. This drastically increases the success rate of fetching data from various websites.  If a paid service isn't desired, a combination of `requests`, `undetected-chromedriver` (a Selenium variant that avoids detection), and rotating proxies (which you'd have to manage yourself) could be used, but this is significantly more complex to implement and maintain. I'm prioritizing reliability and ease of use here, so I'll focus on the ZenRows integration.  `httpx` is another excellent option for modern HTTP requests, supporting HTTP/2, which is less likely to be blocked.
    *   **Alternative (Free, but more complex):** Use `undetected-chromedriver` + proxy management.  This requires more setup and maintenance.
    *   Libraries:  `zenrows`, `httpx` (if we go the non-API route, but ZenRows is preferred for this deep research tool), `requests`, `selenium` (or `undetected-chromedriver`), `beautifulsoup4`, `lxml`

2.  **Improved Question Generation:**
    *   **Problem with original (assumed):** The original probably used a simple method to generate sub-questions, perhaps just appending keywords or using basic string manipulation.
    *   **Solution:** Leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) for more sophisticated and context-aware sub-question generation.  We'll use the OpenAI API (this requires an API key).  The LLM can analyze the initial query and produce a diverse set of relevant sub-questions, leading to a more thorough investigation.
    *   **Alternative:**  If an OpenAI key isn't available, you could use a smaller, locally-run LLM (like a Hugging Face model).  However, the quality of sub-questions might be lower.  Another simpler alternative is to use keyword extraction libraries (like `RAKE-nltk`) to pull out key phrases and form questions around them, but this is far less sophisticated.
    *   Libraries: `openai`

3.  **Summarization and Synthesis:**
    *   **Problem with original (assumed):** The original might have concatenated results or used a very basic summarization technique.
    *   **Solution:** Again, use an LLM (OpenAI API) for high-quality summarization.  We'll provide the LLM with the scraped content from each sub-question and ask it to summarize the key findings. Then, we'll combine the summaries and ask the LLM to synthesize a final, comprehensive answer, citing the sources.
    *   **Alternative:**  If the OpenAI API isn't an option, use a library like `transformers` (with a summarization model from Hugging Face) or `sumy`.  These are less powerful than OpenAI's models, but still provide decent summarization.
    *   Libraries: `openai`, (alternatively: `transformers`, `sumy`)

4.  **Recursive Search (Optional, but Powerful):**
    *   **Concept:**  After the initial round of research, analyze the results to identify *new* questions or areas for deeper investigation.  This creates a recursive loop, going deeper into the topic with each iteration.  This mimics the "deep dive" approach.
    *   **Implementation:**  This is the most complex addition.  We'll use the LLM to analyze the summarized results and generate *new* sub-questions based on gaps in knowledge or interesting leads.  We'll limit the recursion depth to prevent infinite loops.
    *   **Caution:**  This significantly increases API usage (both for web scraping and the LLM), so it should be used judiciously.  A depth limit is crucial.

5.  **Structured Output:**
    *   **Problem with original (assumed):** Output might have been plain text or a simple list.
    *   **Solution:** Generate a well-structured report, potentially in Markdown format, with clear headings, summaries, and citations. This makes the research results easy to read and understand.

6. **Error Handling and Input Validation:**
    * Add `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors like network issues, API errors, and invalid user input.
    * Validate the user's input to ensure it's a valid research topic.

7. **Multi-Agent Frameworks (Conceptual Discussion):**
    * The search results highlight multi-agent frameworks like CrewAI, LangGraph, and AutoGen. These are powerful tools for building complex, collaborative AI systems. While integrating a full multi-agent framework is beyond the scope of this single-script refactor, it's an important consideration for future development.
    * *How it could apply:* You could create specialized agents for different tasks: a "Question Generator Agent," a "Web Scraping Agent," a "Summarization Agent," and a "Report Synthesis Agent." These agents would communicate and collaborate to complete the research task. This is a more advanced architectural approach.

Key changes and explanations in the code:

*   **Environment Variables:**  Uses `os.environ.get()` to load API keys securely.  The user must set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ZENROWS_API_KEY` as environment variables.
*   **ZenRows Integration:**  Uses the `ZenRowsClient` for robust web scraping.  Includes parameters for JavaScript rendering, antibot measures, and premium proxies.
*   **OpenAI API Integration:**  Uses the `openai` library for generating sub-questions and summarizing content.  Uses `gpt-3.5-turbo`, but you can change this to a more powerful model if you have access.
*   **`generate_subquestions()`:**  Generates sub-questions using the OpenAI API.  Includes a prompt that instructs the LLM to consider existing findings (for recursive calls) and to return a numbered list.
*   **`scrape_page()`:**  Uses ZenRows to scrape a single page, handling potential errors.
* **`batch_scrape_pages()`:** Uses ZenRows to concurrently scrape pages and returns the scraped contents as a list.
*   **`summarize_content()`:**  Uses the OpenAI API to summarize a given text, focusing on its relevance to the sub-question.
*   **`extract_text_from_html()`:**  Uses BeautifulSoup to extract clean text from HTML, removing script and style tags.
*   **`synthesize_results()`:**  Combines the summaries from each sub-question into a final, coherent answer using the OpenAI API.
*   **`deep_research()`:**  The main function that orchestrates the entire process:
    *   Generates sub-questions.
    *   Performs Google searches (using ZenRows) for each sub-question.
    *   Extracts relevant links from the search results.
    *   Scrapes the content of each linked page (using ZenRows).
    *   Summarizes the scraped content (using OpenAI).
    *   Synthesizes the summaries into a final report (using OpenAI, only at depth 0).
    *   Recursively calls itself with a new set of sub-questions (if within the depth limit).
*   **Error Handling:** Includes `try-except` blocks to catch potential errors during API calls and web scraping.
*   **Input Validation:** Prompts the user for input until a non-empty research topic is provided.
*   **Constants:** Uses constants to control the number of sub-questions, recursion depth, summary length, and ZenRows concurrency.
*   **Search Result Filtering:** Added basic filtering of search result URLs to exclude common non-result pages (like Google's own pages, YouTube, Wikipedia).  This can be customized further.
*   **Comments and Docstrings:**  Added extensive comments and docstrings to explain each part of the code.
*    **Recursive Call:** Added recursive call logic within the `deep_research()` function, allowing it to delve deeper based on previous results.
* **Main execution block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)**: Ensures the code runs only when executed as a script. It handles user input, API key checks, and error handling.

**To Run the Code:**

1.  **Install Libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install openai requests beautifulsoup4 lxml zenrows
    ```
2.  **Set Environment Variables:**
    *   Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI API key.
    *   Set `ZENROWS_API_KEY` to your ZenRows API key.  You'll need to sign up for a ZenRows account (they have a free trial).
    *   How to set environment variables depends on your operating system (Google "set environment variable Windows/Mac/Linux").
3.  **Run the Script:**
    ```bash
    python deep_research.py
    ```

This improved version provides a much more robust and comprehensive "deep research" tool, addressing the limitations of a basic approach and incorporating best practices for web scraping, question generation, and summarization. The recursive element, while potentially costly in terms of API usage, allows for a much more in-depth exploration of the research topic. Remember to adjust the constants and model choices according to your needs and API access.
